# DataScience Miscellaneous Functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Why are they need ?
Let me tell you a story while working n google colab i fouf that within 30 minutes and sometime randomly system used to go out with drive. And then  you have to do all the exercise again and again in your colab notebook
So to save time and avoid this stupid colab inconsistency, i plan to make these while thinking of these functions i quickly realized that an indian kaggle grandmaster once said i am fast because i have so many scripts which help me to move faster than other. This also inpired me to collect all thee functions in one place.

Hope they may be useful, once this grows i will try to make it as a class and make it an open source project.
